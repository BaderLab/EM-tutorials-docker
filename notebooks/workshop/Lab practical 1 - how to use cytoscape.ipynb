    "\n",
    "### 3. Explore the network.\n",
    "  * Locate the ‘Zoom In’ icon located in the ‘Cytoscape Tools’ bar at the top of the session window. Zoom in until you are able to comfortably read the node labels. \n",

    " \n",
    "### 4. Network navigation\n",
    "To be able to move the network and center on modules or nodes of interest, locate the ‘Control Panel’ on the left side, find and select the ‘Network’ tab. At the bottom of the tab, click on the blue rectangle. Navigate through the entire network to examine the different proteins and their interactions by moving the blue rectangle (bird eye view).  \n",

    "  * To create a subnetwork of the proteins directly associated with ‘BRCA1’,First select the node of interest, BRCA1. (step 5)\n",
    "  * locate and click the ‘First Neighbors of Selected Nodes’ icon (2 houses) on the ‘Cytoscape Tools’ bar. ‘BRCA1’ and the direct interacting proteins are highlighted in yellow. \n",

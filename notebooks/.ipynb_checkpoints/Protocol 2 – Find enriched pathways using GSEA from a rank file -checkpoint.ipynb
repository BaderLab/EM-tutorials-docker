    "GSEA accesses the GMT files from MSigDB website directly but the user can also supply their own file.  We recommend for users doing an analysis in Human, Mouse or Rat to download monthly updated gmt files from http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/current_release/ and load them into GSEA manually.  There are multiple file options available.  For description of source databases and file structure see http://baderlab.org/GeneSets. By default we recommend using HumanGOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_{Date}_{ID}.gmt.<BR>\n",

On the other hand if there is an abundance of results or you wish to focus on specific pathways you can use the set derived just from pathway databases (file 5) or choose a specific database or set of databases from the Pathways directory.**</span>\n",

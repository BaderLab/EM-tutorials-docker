    "Once the Enrichment Map is created the next step involves interpreting and refining it to ultimately create a figure that can be used to explain the question of interest or uncover new avenues of research.  There are many Cytoscape features and third –party Apps that can help analyze and refine an Enrichment Map.   A few of these are explored in this protocol but only brush the surface of what can be done within Cytoscape. "
